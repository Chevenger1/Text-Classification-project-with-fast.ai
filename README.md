# Text-Classification-project-with-fast.ai
It was done while learning NLP from Practical Deep Learning For Coders by Jeremy Howard.
This project involves the implementation of a text classification model using PyTorch. The model is trained on the AG News dataset using a neural network architecture consisting of an embedding layer, a linear layer, and a cross-entropy loss function. The training and validation data are loaded using PyTorch's DataLoader and are preprocessed using a tokenizer and a vocabulary. The project also uses TensorBoard to visualize the training and validation loss and accuracy metrics. The final model achieves an accuracy of over 90% on the test dataset. This project can be used as a starting point for developing more advanced text classification models using PyTorch.
